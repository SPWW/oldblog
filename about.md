I am a technican working in HKU, kind like a computer science faculty member. I don't want to say I am a member of computer science department is because actully I have never been a student of conmputer science. 

I have two bachelor degrees from Beijing Institute of Tecnology, LL.B. and Bsc. And after that I worked three years in H3C focusing on linux driver programming. After that I quite my job and got my master degree in CUHK.

So basicly that is my experience, and I like programming and building things as a programmer.
