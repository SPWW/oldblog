# 1/24 #

In China, the biggest festival is spring festival which is someday on February. So it is notmal to see people say "happy new year" even after Jaunary. But the truth is this "new year" has passed 1/12 and something you plan for the new year should have missed the best opportunity.

Today is Jan 13th. 2016 has passed 1/24.
